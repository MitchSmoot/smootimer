## Project shelved

Project shelved for now, I intend to take this concept much further in the future, and it is high on the list for future projects.

# SmooTimer, a SpeedCubing Timer App

This is a web application to facilitate progress tracking for speedcubing. Each user submits their times by timing themselves live. Their times are then saved to their account, so that improvement can be tracked over time. The Timer layout will contains a Javascript Timer, used to create data on the spot for solve times. On that same page, There is a chart representing their submitted times over a period of time. Each point can be moused over to show the exact time of the solve. In an upcoming update (late fall/early winter 2018), users will also have the ability to compare their charts to that of other users, by overlaying their data sets on onto the same chart but in different colors.
